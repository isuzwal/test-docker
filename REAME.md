#  CI/CD with GitHub Actions

While building this mini project to learn **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, I ended up exploring **CI/CD using GitHub Actions**.  

Through this process, I learned how to:
-  Write and structure workflow pipelines using `.yml` files.  
-  Run automated tests when pushing code to the **main** branch or creating a **pull request**.  
- Build and push Docker images directly to **Docker Hub** using GitHub Actions.  
-  Understand how CI/CD pipelines automate testing, building, and deployment.  

This small project turned into a great learning experience — giving me a better understanding of how real-world teams manage continuous integration and delivery using automation.
